# Bindweave Unoptimized Workflow
This is a workflow taken from one of Kijai's bindweave preview videos on his Bindweave branch (he posted them in an issue someone opened there)
Still not optimazed, but hey, it works. 

With the 4 steps lora it takes around 2 minutes for the first run and around 70 seconds after cold start.
